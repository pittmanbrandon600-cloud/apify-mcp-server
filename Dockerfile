# `pnpm deploy --legacy --filter` produces a self-contained node_modules for the
# named package with production dependencies only — the pnpm equivalent of
# `npm ci --omit=dev`, with no extra registry resolution at runtime.
# - `--filter` is required from the workspace root so pnpm knows which package to
#   deploy (workspace contains both the server and the `src/web` widget package).
# - `--legacy` opts out of pnpm v10+'s `inject-workspace-packages` requirement; the
#   server doesn't depend on any workspace package at runtime, so the legacy path is
#   the correct one (see ERR_PNPM_DEPLOY_NONINJECTED_WORKSPACE).
