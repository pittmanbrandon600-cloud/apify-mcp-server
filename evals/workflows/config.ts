TASK REQUIREMENTS:
{{reference}}

AGENT CONVERSATION:
{{conversation}}

Your task is to evaluate if the agent met ALL the requirements listed above.

Evaluation criteria:
1. Did the agent use appropriate tools to accomplish the task?
2. Were the tool calls made with correct arguments?
3. Did the agent provide a clear, helpful final response to the user?
4. Did the agent fully address all requirements?

Important notes:
- Focus on whether requirements were met, not on writing style
- The agent may use different tools than expected if they accomplish the same goal
- Tool results are not shown (only tool calls and agent responses)
- Minor inefficiencies are acceptable if the task was completed

Provide your evaluation with a verdict (PASS or FAIL) and a brief explanation (1-2 sentences).`;
