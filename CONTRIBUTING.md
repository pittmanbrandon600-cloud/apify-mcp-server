# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome! This document describes how to contribute to this repository. Following these guidelines helps us maintain a clean history, consistent quality, and smooth review process.
All pull requests are subject to automated and manual review against these guidelines.

---

## Before you write code

**Send us the problem, not the patch.**

Generating a patch is cheap; validating the right patch takes maintainer time. A pull request with no agreed problem behind it is a proposal we must reverse-engineer from a diff, so we will close it.

### 1. Open an issue

Use the templates — [bug report](https://github.com/apify/apify-mcp-server/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) or [feature request](https://github.com/apify/apify-mcp-server/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml) — and include relevant versions, configuration, and logs. They turn a report into a fix.

Two things the form can't enforce:

- **Evidence over adjectives.** "Users are confused" is weak; "3 users hit this on Claude Desktop, log attached" is strong.
- **Write it yourself.** A pasted agent transcript is not an issue. Trim it to the point first.

### 2. We take it from there

**An open issue is not an invitation to implement it.** Some are unrefined, stale, or parked because the right fix is not settled. We decide what gets built and when — filing a good issue *is* the contribution.

Two exceptions: **documentation fixes** (typos, broken links, wrong commands) go straight to a PR, and **work a maintainer invited you to do** — scope it to that issue and link it with `Closes #123`.

---

## AI-assisted contributions

AI tools are welcome — we use them, and this repo ships [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) for them. These rules are about accountability, and they don't replace the issue-first process above.

- **Reviewers talk to you, not your agent.** Answer review comments in your own words.
- **Disclose AI assistance.** In the issue or PR description, name the tool and what it did. Do not add a model as a co-author.
- **Show it works.** Include a test, an `mcpc` transcript, a screenshot, or an Actor run. Green CI alone is not enough.
- **Do not post automated AI review comments** on your PR or other people's.
- **Verify issues yourself.** Don't file a bug an agent "found" without reproducing it, and never file a speculative security report.

Contributions that ignore this are closed with a link here. Repeated low-effort submissions lead to restricted participation.

## Branch naming

The default branch is `master`. Feature branches must follow the `type/short-description` format, where `type` matches the conventional commit type:

```text
feat/add-dataset-tool
fix/connection-timeout
chore/update-dependencies
refactor/tool-registry
docs/update-readme
```

---

## Commit Messages and PR Titles

All commits and PR titles must follow the **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)** format.
Both the **type** (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, etc.) and the **scope** (the component in parentheses) are required.
To indicate a **breaking change**, append `!` after the scope (e.g., `feat!: ...`).

We use this format to determine version bumps and to generate changelogs.
It applies to both commit messages and PR titles, since PRs are merged using squash and the PR title becomes the commit message.

### Examples of Good Messages

```text
feat: Add new tool for fetching actor details
feat!: Migrate to new MCP SDK version [internal]
fix: Handle connection errors gracefully
refactor: Improve type definitions [ignore]
chore: Update dependencies
```

---

## Pull Request Descriptions

Your PR description should extend your commit message:
- Explain **what**, **why**, and **how**.
- Mention potential risks.
- Provide instructions for reviewers.
- Link related issues or resources.

---

## Pull Request Comments

Use comments to guide reviewers:
- Flag code that was **just moved**, so they don't re-review it.
- Explain reasoning behind non-obvious changes.
- Highlight extra cleanup or unrelated fixes.

---

## Pull Request Size

- Aim for ≤ **300 lines changed**.
- Large PRs should be split into smaller, focused changes.

---

## Coding Standards & Pitfalls

### Key reminders
*   **Keep logic flat**: avoid deep nesting and unnecessary `else`; return early instead.
*   **Readability first**: small, focused functions and consistent naming.
*   **Error handling**: always handle and propagate errors clearly.
*   **Minimal parameters**: functions should only accept what they actually use.
*   **Reuse utilities**: prefer existing helpers instead of re-implementing logic.
*   **Consistency reinforcement**: rely on the shared ESLint config (`@apify/eslint-config`) and EditorConfig settings to enforce standards automatically.

### Standards
*   **Avoid `else`:** Return early to reduce indentation and keep logic flat.

*   **Naming:** Use full, descriptive names. Avoid single-letter variables except for common loop indices (e.g., `i` for index).
    * **Constants:** When a constant is global (defined at the module's top level), immutable, and optionally exported, use uppercase `SNAKE_CASE` format.
        * If a different applicable naming rule is defined below, that rule takes precedence (e.g., for classes, components, functions, Zod validators, schemas, ...).
    * **Functions & Variables:** Use `camelCase` format.
    * **Classes, Types, Schemas, Components:** Use capitalized `PascalCase` format.
    * **Files & Folders:** Use lowercase `snake_case` format.
    * **Endpoint Paths:** Use lowercase `kebab-case` format.
    * **Booleans:** Prefix with `is`, `has`, `can`, or `should` (e.g., `isValid`, `hasFinished`, `canRetry`, `shouldRetry`).
    * **Function verbs:** Choose the verb based on what the function does:
        * `get` — synchronous or cheap lookup from local state, cache, or in-memory data (e.g., `getToolFullName`, `getDefaultTools`).
        * `fetch` — async retrieval from an external API or network call (e.g., `fetchActorDetails`, `fetchActorRunData`).
        * `build` — construct and return a new object from inputs (e.g., `buildMCPResponse`, `buildActorInputSchema`).
        * `create` — factory function that instantiates a class, service, or complex object (e.g., `createExpressApp`, `createProgressTracker`).
        * `parse` — extract structured data from raw/untrusted input (e.g., `parseServerMode`, `parseInputParamsFromUrl`).
        * `resolve` — determine a value from context, configuration, or multiple sources (e.g., `resolveOutputOptions`, `resolveServerMode`).
        * `format` — convert data to a display or output representation (e.g., `formatActorToActorCard`, `formatActorForWidget`).
        * `extract` — pull a specific piece of data from a larger structure (e.g., `extractActorId`, `extractActorName`).
        * `validate` — check correctness and throw/return errors (e.g., `validateInput`).
        * Avoid `make` and `compute` — use `build`/`create` and `get`/`resolve` respectively.
    * **Type suffixes:** Use consistent suffixes for type names:
        * `Options` — configuration passed to a function or constructor (e.g., `ActorsMcpServerOptions`, `SchemaGenerationOptions`).
        * `Result` — return type of a function (e.g., `ActorDetailsResult`, `CallActorGetDatasetResult`).
        * `Params` — input parameters grouped into an object (e.g., `ActorExecutionParams`, `ApifyRequestParams`).
        * `Info` — read-only data describing an entity (e.g., `ActorInfo`, `PricingInfo`).
        * `Context` — ambient state passed through a call chain (e.g., `ToolTelemetryContext`).
        * `Config` — static configuration shape (e.g., `WidgetConfig`).
        * Do not use `Type` or `Kind` suffixes.
    * **Collections:** Name arrays as plurals (e.g., `actorTools`, `PRICING_TIERS`). Suffix Sets with `_SET` or use a descriptive plural (e.g., `CATEGORY_NAME_SET`, `SKYFIRE_ENABLED_TOOLS`). Name Maps and Records descriptively (e.g., `WIDGET_REGISTRY`, `LOG_LEVEL_MAP`).
    * **Units:** Suffix with the unit of measure (e.g., `externalCostUsd`, `intervalMillis`).
    * **Date/Time:** Suffix with `At` (e.g., `updateStartedAt`, `paidAt`).
    * **Zod Validators:** Suffix with `Validator`.
    * **Text/Copy:** Use the branded term `Actor` (capitalized) instead of `actor` in user-facing texts, labels, notifications, error messages, etc.

*   **String formatting:**
    * Use plain single-quoted strings for short one-liners.
    * Use `dedent` (tagged template literal) for any string that would otherwise exceed `max-len` or span multiple lines — including tool `description` fields, LLM instructions, and single-sentence strings that are simply long.
        * Inline `dedent` directly as a property or variable value — do not extract it to a named constant.
        * For top-level string constants that are already flush-left, use a plain template literal — `dedent` only helps when indentation from surrounding code would otherwise be embedded in the string.
        * `dedent` introduces `\n` at each source line break. This is fine for LLM-facing strings (tool descriptions, instructions, notes), but avoid it for strings where whitespace is significant or where `\n` would break rendering (e.g. UI labels, log messages, URLs).
        * Do not interpolate values that start at column 0 (e.g. `JSON.stringify` output) inside `dedent` — `dedent` computes minimum indentation across all lines including interpolated ones, so a flush-left value sets `mindent = 0` and leaves all template lines with stray leading spaces. Use a `texts[]` array or plain template literal instead.
        * For strings where `\n` is not acceptable, use string concatenation (`+`) to split across lines for `max-len` compliance.
        ```typescript
        import dedent from 'dedent';

        // Multi-line prose — always use dedent
        export const toolEntry = {
            name: 'example-tool',
            description: dedent`
                Line 1.
                Line 2.

                USAGE:
                - Example
            `,
        };

        // Long single sentence going to LLM — dedent is fine, \n is ok
        const note = isLimited ? dedent`
            You only have a preview (${count} of ${total} items).
            Do not present this as the full output.
        ` : '';

        // Long string where \n is NOT ok (e.g. log message) — use + instead
        const msg = `Something failed for actor "${actorName}"`
            + ` with status ${status}.`;
        ```
    * Avoid `[].join('\n')` for multiline strings — it is noisy and harder to edit.
    * When migrating existing strings, keep the wording **semantically unchanged**.

*   **Comments:**
    * Use proper English (spelling, grammar, punctuation, capitalization).
    * Use JSDoc `/**` for documentation, `//` for generic comments, and avoid `/*` (single asterisk multiline comments).
    * **Comment the *why*, not the *what*.** Good comments explain intent, trade-offs, and non-obvious constraints — never restate what the code already says. Follow these rules:
        1. **Don't duplicate the code.** Delete comments that narrate the next line (e.g. `// Apply filter if configured` above the `if`, `// Helper to format X` above `formatX`). If the code says it, the comment shouldn't.
        2. **Don't use comments to excuse unclear code.** Fix the name or the structure instead of explaining a bad one.
        3. **If you can't write a clear comment, the code is probably the problem.** A comment you struggle to phrase is a signal to simplify the code.
        4. **Dispel confusion, don't cause it.** A comment that contradicts the code (wrong `@param`, stale example, inverted assertion) is worse than none — keep comments in sync with the code they describe.
        5. **Explain unidiomatic code.** When code is deliberately unusual (a cast the compiler forces, a workaround for an upstream quirk), say why. This is the comment that earns its place.
        6. **Link the source of copied/adapted code.** Paste a URL to the original.
        7. **Link external references where they help.** API endpoints, spec sections, algorithms — link the exact page (e.g. the matching `docs.apify.com/api/v2/...` slug), not a generic one.
        8. **Comment bug fixes.** When a line exists to fix a bug or work around a defect, note it and link the issue (`// see apify/apify-mcp-server#637`).
        9. **Mark incomplete work.** Use `TODO`/`FIXME` with concrete context and an issue link where one exists (e.g. `TODO(#675): ...`) — not a vague `// TODO: fix this`.
    * **No commented-out code.** Delete it; git history is the archive. Don't repeat the same comment across many lines — state it once (file- or block-level) or make the code self-explanatory.

*   **Parameters**
    * **Minimal Parameters:** Pass only the parameters that the function actually uses.
        * When the parameter is an object (e.g., User), include only the fields used by the function instead of passing full objects with unnecessary data.
        * Use TypeScript generics or utility types to preserve correct typing while narrowing the shape.
            ```typescript
            export const getTransformedUser = <TUser extends FieldsRequiredForGetTransformedUser>(
                user: TUser,
            ): TUser & TransformedUserFields => { /* ... */ };
            ```
    * **Function Parameters:**
        * You may define a function with a comma-separated list of parameters **only if it has up to 3 parameters**.
            ```typescript
            public async getActorBasicInfo(
                actorId: string,
                impersonatedUserId: string,
                token: string
            ): Promise<ActorBasicInfo | null> { /* ... */ };
            ```
        * If the function has **more than 3 parameters**, define it with a **single object parameter** that contains them.
            ```typescript
            private ensureActorAccess = async ({ actorId, userId, token, req }: {
                actorId: string;
                userId: string;
                token: string;
                req: AuthenticatedRequest;
            }) => { /* ... */ };
            ```
        * Optional parameters must be at the end of the list.
    * **Optional Parameters (`?` vs `| undefined`):**
        * Use `?` if calling the function *without* the parameter makes sense.
        * Use `| undefined` if the parameter *should* be passed but might be undefined for a specific reason (e.g., not found).

*   **Async functions**
    * **`await` vs `void`:**
        * Use `await` when you care about the Promise result or exceptions.
        * Use `void` when you don't need to wait for the Promise (e.g., fire-and-forget operations).
    * **Use `return await` when returning Promises:**
        * Ensures that exceptions are thrown within the current function, preserving accurate stack traces and making debugging easier.

*   **Enumerations:**
    * Define as `as const` object instead of TypeScript `enum`.
    * Name both the enumeration object and its keys in singular uppercase `SNAKE_CASE` format.
    * Ensure that each key and its value are identical.
    * Create a TypeScript type with the same name as the enumeration object.
        ```typescript
        export const ACTOR_STATUS = {
            READY: 'READY',
            RUNNING: 'RUNNING',
            SUCCEEDED: 'SUCCEEDED',
        } as const;
        export type ACTOR_STATUS = ValueOf<typeof ACTOR_STATUS>;
        ```

*   **`type` vs `interface`:**
    * Prefer `type` for flexibility.
    * Use `interface` only when it's required for class implementations (`implements`).

*   **Types organization:**
    * Centralize shared/public types in `src/types.ts`.
    * Co-locate module-specific types next to their usage (same file or a local `types.ts`).
    * Use a folder-level `types.ts` when multiple files in a folder share types, instead of inflating the root `src/types.ts`.

*   **Code Structure:**
    * Keep functions short, focused, and cohesive.
    * Declare variables close to their first use.
    * Extract reusable or complex logic into named helper functions.
    * **Avoid intermediate variables for single-use expressions** — don't create a variable if it's only used once; inline it directly.
        * ❌ Don't: `const docSourceEnum = z.enum([...]); const schema = z.object({ docSource: docSourceEnum })`
        * ✅ Do: `const schema = z.object({ docSource: z.enum([...]) })`
        * Exception: Only create intermediate variables if they improve readability for complex expressions.

*   **Immutability:**
    * Avoid mutating function parameters.
    * If mutation is absolutely necessary (e.g., for performance), clearly document and explain it with a comment.

*   **Imports:**
    * Imports are ordered and grouped automatically by ESLint: builtin → external → parent/sibling → index → object, alphabetized within groups, with newlines between groups.
    * Use `import type` for type-only imports.
    * Do not duplicate imports — reuse existing ones.
    * Do not use dynamic imports unless explicitly required.

*   **Readability vs. Performance:**
    * Prioritize readability over micro-optimizations.
    * For performance-critical code, optimize only when justified and document the reasoning.

*   **Assertions & Validations:**
    * Use **Zod** for schema-based validation of complex shapes or intricate checks.
    * Use **custom validators and assertions** for lightweight, in-code checks - e.g. validating primitive values, simple shapes, or decision logic inside functions.
    * **No double validation:** When using Zod schemas with AJV (`ajvValidate` in tool definitions), do NOT add redundant manual validation — let the schema handle it. Use the parsed data directly.

*   **Error Handling:**
    * **User Errors:**
        * Use appropriate error codes (4xx for client errors).
        * Log as `softFail` or appropriate level.
    * **Internal Errors:**
        * Use appropriate error codes (5xx for server errors).
        * Log with `log.exception`, `log.error`, or appropriate error logging.
    * **Don't log then throw:** Do NOT call `log.error()` immediately before throwing — the error will be logged by the caller. This creates duplicate logs and violates separation of concerns.
        * ❌ Don't: `log.error('Something failed'); throw new Error('Something failed');`
        * ✅ Do: `throw new Error('Something failed');`

*   **Logging:**
    * Log meaningful information for debugging, especially errors in critical system parts.
    * Use appropriate log levels:
        * `softFail` - client errors
        * `exception` / `error` - server errors
        * `warn` - suspicious but non-critical behavior
        * `info` - progress or important state changes
        * `debug` - local development
    * **Mezmo (logDNA) promotion rule:** Mezmo automatically promotes log entries to error level when the log message or a data value contains the standalone word `"error"` (case-insensitive, e.g. the SDK send-path wrap `Failed to send response: Error: …`). `Error`/`ERROR` embedded in identifiers (`mcpErrorCode` key, `INTERNAL_ERROR`) has no word boundary and is safe. To avoid false error alerts in `softFail` calls:
        * Use `errMessage` as the data key (not `error`) when logging an error message string.
        * Sanitize the error message string with `sanitizeMezmoMessage()` from `src/utils/logging.ts` (replaces every whole-word `"error"` — any case — with `"failure"`).
        * Avoid the word `"error"` in the `softFail` message string itself.
        * Example: `log.softFail('Client disconnected', { errMessage: sanitizeMezmoMessage(err.message) })`

*   **Sensitive Data:**
    * Never send sensitive information without proper permission checks.
    * Sanitize data before sending or logging.
    * Use appropriate data structures to limit exposed fields.

*   **Common patterns:**
    * **Tool implementation**: Tools are defined in `src/tools/` using Zod schemas for validation.
    * **Actor interaction**: Use `src/utils/apify_client.ts` for Apify API calls — never call the Apify API directly.
    * **Error responses**: Return user-friendly error messages with suggestions.
    * **Input validation**: Always validate tool inputs with Zod before processing.
    * **Caching**: Use TTL-based caching for Actor schemas and details (see `src/utils/ttl_lru.ts`).
    * **Constants and tool names**: Always use constants and never hardcoded values. When referring to tools, ALWAYS use the `HELPER_TOOLS` `as const` object.
        * Exception: Integration tests (`tests/integration/`) must use hardcoded strings for tool names. This ensures tests fail if a tool is renamed, preventing accidental breaking changes.

*   **Anti-patterns:**
    * Don't call Apify API directly — always use the Apify client utilities.
    * Don't mutate function parameters without clear documentation.
    * Don't skip input validation — all tool inputs must be validated with Zod.
    * Don't use `Promise.then()` — prefer `async/await`.
    * Don't create tools without proper error handling and user-friendly messages.
    * Don't add features not in the requirements.
    * Don't refactor working code unless asked.
    * Don't add error handling for impossible scenarios.
    * Don't create abstractions for one-time operations.
    * Don't optimize prematurely.

## Design System Compliance (MANDATORY)

**READ FIRST**: [src/web/DESIGN_SYSTEM_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md](src/web/DESIGN_SYSTEM_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md) — Complete design system rules.

**Quick Rules** (Zero tolerance):
- ✅ ALWAYS use `theme.*` tokens (colors, spacing)
- ❌ NEVER hardcode: `#hex`, `rgb()`, `Npx` values, font sizes
- ✅ Import from `@apify/ui-library` only
- ✅ Check `mcp__storybook__*` and `mcp__figma__*` availability before UI work
- ✅ Call `mcp__storybook__get-ui-building-instructions` first
- ✅ Read 1-3 similar components for patterns (max 3 files)
- ✅ Verify zero hardcoded values before submitting

**Figma Integration**: Call `mcp__figma__get_design_context` when working from designs.
